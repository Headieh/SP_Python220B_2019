A module that uses closures and currying to create and update an inventory CSV
file with all the information that is currently entered through the spreadsheet
program. Also includes functionality to to bulk-process a list of items, coming
from a separate CSV file, that have been rented out to a single customer. This
functionality will thus update the inventory list by adding that customerâ€™s
rentals.
