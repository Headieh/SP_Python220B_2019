# performance improvement notes
- debugged and coded on ~300k file
- ran final on 1m records
- analyzie function called inside a wrapper function to allow for arguments to be passed inside timeit
- created a good and bad perf handlers to measure performance of each
- 1m file creation added into a seperate class. Each time it is called it increases the test file by 100k rows
- perf improvement #1, open just one reader (removed 2nd) ~40-50% savings (later convert to a generator
- perf improvement #2, remove unused var assignment, ~.02-.03 at 300k rows
- perf improvement #3, replaced reader with generator, ~.6 to .5 at 300k rows, potential huge savings with a very large file that could create mem errors

- final performance with 1m rows:
- analyzer runs nearly 3x more efeciently than original
