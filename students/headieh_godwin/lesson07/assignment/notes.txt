- Expanded fake data using expand_data.py script.

- I originally timed parallel and linear and found that linear was actually
slightly faster. This was before I amended the import logic for linear.py
the way parallel was amended so that it can process the imports in parallel.
After amending the linear.py script to have 3 separate imports, parallel is
faster than linear. Therefore I don't really think it was worth it however it
is possible that if the database was even larger that eventually linear would have
been slower and worth the change. A point of contention might be when one thread
is waiting for an object that is currently being held by another thread. So if
you lock the object in the queue when another thread is expecting it, then the
for loop that runs the threads will be infinite.

Linear:
products ~ 0.94s
customers ~ 0.98s
rentals ~ 0.93s
total time ~ 2.87s

Parallel:
total time ~ 1.53s
